emacs-keybindings-in-osx
========================

A customized keybinding to enable more of the emacs keybindings in Cocoa widgets (i.e. all native text widgets on OSX)

My version of stuff info gleaned from [this article](www.erasetotheleft.com/post/mac-os-x-key-bindings).  As of this writing that article has long been gone, so I've republished it [here](http://funkworks.blogspot.com/2013/03/republishing-of-wwwerasetotheleftcompos.html)

To install

```bash
    % ./install.sh
```
